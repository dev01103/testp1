Solve param-dependant parts (like depending on used view or action)
More than one part in one position
Parts occuring more than one time
Optimize iterated variables in the template. For example mark all iterable in varArray (function for iterated ones).


Menus
Manage view for some parts maybe
Get foreign models (perhaps solution for above)
Layout functionality for templates/parts
Subparts without database (?)

# Error in a href in templates - partially solved (still some of hrefs goes into positions)
